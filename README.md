## Overview

The Pi Calculator is a Python program that calculates and prints the digits of the mathematical constant π (pi) up to a specified number of decimal places. It uses a generator function to efficiently compute and display the digits of π.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the `pi_calculator.py` file.
2. Open your terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where `pi_calculator.py` is located.
4. Run the program by executing the following command:

    ```shell
    python pi_calculator.py
    ```

5. Follow the on-screen instructions:

    - Enter the number of decimal places to calculate π up to.
    - Optionally, you can choose to view the source code of the program by entering `1` when prompted.

6. The program will start calculating π and display the digits as they are computed. It will also create a period after the first digit.

## Notes

- The program may slow down with more digits calculated due to technical limitations.
- The program will automatically close after 10 seconds once the calculation is complete.
